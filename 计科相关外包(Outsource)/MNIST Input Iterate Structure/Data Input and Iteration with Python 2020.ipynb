    "# Goals of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review acquisition of data from text files with Python\n",
    "- Learn to structure data in Python variables that facilitate various analyses\n",
    "- Gain experience with <font face='courier'>for</font> loops\n",
    "- Gain insight into multidimensional data structures\n",
    "- Gain expertise in structuring data within multidimensional data structures\n",
    "- Introduce you to terms used in industry, such as _customer retention_ and _networks_\n",
    "- Introduce you to topics in future MSBA courses\n",
    "  - Reshaping multidimensional arrays (AI - neural networks)\n",
    "  - Markov models, stochastic models\n",
    "  - Time series analysis\n",

    "Business analytics professionals must know how to access data programmatically, clean it, and structure it to suit the requirements of the intended methodology.  Some methologies might require data in lists while other methodologies might require dictionaries.  This session helps develop this skill using basic Python commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional data is often referred to as n-dimensional data and tensors.  Some examples are shown below.  While vectors and matrices are technically tensors, the name tensor is frequently reserved for data structures of three or more dimensions.  You must be able to iterate through these data structures to simply retrieve the elements or to use the element values in mathematical operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Acquiring and structuring data within Python variables requires loops, and so this material relies heavily on loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, you will often use the <font face='courier'>numpy</font> and <font face='courier'>pandas</font> packages to ease data acquisition and structuring.  These packages, however, hide the details from you which are very important to know.  for example, numpy and pandas does the operations we will demonstrate _under the covers_ and you will not be able to troubleshoot problems with those packages unless you understand the basics.  It is important, therefore, to practice these computations with loop statements that we explicitly write which gives you the essential insight into what the more advanced programming statements are doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever lists or dictionaries are created with <font face='courier'>for</font> loops, it is natural to think about doing so more succinctly using list comprehension and dictionary comprehension, respectively.  We will cover these alternate methods in this session, therefore, as well.\n",

You can surely think of other examples.\n",

    "One issue that arises with time series data is to summarize the pattern over time despite there being frequent highs and lows (noise) and highs and lows over longer periods (either economic cycles or seasonal effects).  Computing the moving average is a frequently used method for summarizing the trend that is muddied by the short-term noise.\n",

So, a customer's state is indicated by an integer from $0$ to $\\infty$, which is the number of seasons since their last purchase.  What is described above is called a _periodic_ system because we observe customers' states at discrete periodic intervals where, here, each period is one season long.\n",

These probabiltiies are typical represented in a _Transition Matrix_ as shown below.  The notation $p_{x,y}$ represents the probability, or percentage of customers, on average, who transition from State $x$ to State $y$.  Note that it makes sense for all probabilities in each row to sum to $1$ because all customers (100%) in any state must transition to some state.  Call the entirety of this matrix $P$.\n",

Studies of other networks such as electrical grids reveal small-world networks that are highly connected.  One famous paper on this topic is by Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz [Watts & Strogatz](http://worrydream.com/refs/Watts-CollectiveDynamicsOfSmallWorldNetworks.pdf).\n",

The sparse connections ebtween highly-connected clusters identify the vulnerable parts of the network that could cause widespread electricity outages, as illustrated below.  See [Related GE Grid Story](https://www.ge.com/reports/post/74545123735/its-a-small-world-ge-google-maps-to-draw-a/), [Related Academic Article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5448813), and [Another Academic Article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4116107).
